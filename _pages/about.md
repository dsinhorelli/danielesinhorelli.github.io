## ...This Website
On this website, I'll present some of the things I'm currently working on and also some of my old projects. As an Engineer, I'm always looking forward learning and trying new things. So, I hope you will enjoy it!

If I had to describe myself in one sentence, I would say: 

<div class="message">
<b>I'm a believer and a doer</b>
</div>

*Believer* because I'm a guy with a entrepreneur mindset, self learner that is never afraid of challenges;  and a *doer* since I always work very hard until I solve the problems or prove to myself there're more profitable ones to tackle!  

I'm also an Electrical Engineer (Five Years, full-time, just a few survivors at the end...) with a M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering / Automation (Two Years, full-time, maybe even less survivors at the end...), both from [UFRGS/Brazil](http://www.ufrgs.br/english/home) and, since 2017, I hold a Ph.D in Robotics/A.I. degree (full-time, maybe the coolest and hardest experience in my life, and I managed to survive again!) from [University of Plymouth/UK](https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/). 


Starting with my undergrad certificate, it says "Electrical Engineer" and my training had the basic blocks from traditional Electrical Engineering degrees (Calculus, Physics, Circuits, Electromagnetism, Signal Processing, Electrical Materials, more Advanced Calculus, etc.) , but it was also strongly focused on what most people would recognize nowadays as an Electronics degree (Microcontrollers, Digital Electronics, Control Systems, Digital Communications, Power Electronics, etc.). To give you an idea, my final project (yes, undergrads had to develop a project, with a dissertation and defend it during a public presentation, oral examination, with three examiners) was a system, 100% assembly language, to write messages using composite video signals ([TEXvid](https://github.com/ricardodeazambuja/TEXvid)). My M.Sc., again, had a dissertation and public presentation, but with at least one external examiner. The results from my M.Sc. (Wireless Power Transmission) can be seen on my [publications page](../publications/). During my Master's degree, I'd attended modules about Stochastic Processes, Advanced Digital Signal Processing (STFT, Wavelets, Hilbert Transforms...), Instrumentation, Optimization and Design of Experiments.  

I've been an entrepreneur since ever ([Engineering Company](http://ricardodeazambuja.com/azamec/index_e.html), Bookshop, Publishing House, Express Printing Services, Website Development, etc) 

I love electronics, programming, robotics and, whenever I can, I also try to design and build new things using [wood](../public/images/MyRadialRouter.jpg?style=centerme) or [3D printed parts](http://www.thingiverse.com/ricardodeazambuja/designs), but sometimes I also enjoy taking old things apart to reuse or just to see what is inside!

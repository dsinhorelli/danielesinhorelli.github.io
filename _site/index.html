    <span class="post-date">06 Apr 2017</span>
    <p>Currently, I’m a last year Robotics / Artificial Intelligence Ph.D candidate (don’t be shy, have a look at my <a target="_blank" href="http://localhost:4000/publications/">publications</a>), father of a 7-yrs-old boy and I’m living abroad with my family since 2013. So, life is quite busy, a little bit stressful and it happens that, sometimes, I simply forget things. The other day, I was setting up a new Dell laptop (I’ve bought it really, really cheap from their UK outlet, free delivery and I even got an extra student discount!) that came with <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_10">Windows 10</a> and, as always, I created a very hard to guess password. It was so hard to guess that I forgot it after a week! And that’s how the idea for this post began.</p>

        Easy-peasy Deep Learning and Convolutional Networks with Keras - Part 2
      </a>
    </h1>
    <span class="post-date">05 Mar 2017</span>
    <p>This is the continuation (finally!), or the <em>Part 2</em>, of the <a target="_blank" href="http://localhost:4000/deep_learning/2017/01/29/easy-peasy_deep_learning/">“Easy-peasy Deep Learning and Convolutional Networks with Keras”</a>. This post should be something self-contained, but you may enjoy reading <a target="_blank" href="http://localhost:4000/deep_learning/2017/01/29/easy-peasy_deep_learning/"><em>Part 1</em></a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://localhost:4000/deep_learning/2017/02/12/easy-peasy_deep_learning_one_and_a_half/"><em>Part 1½</em></a>… it’s up to you.</p>

<p>Around one week ago, I’d attended a <a target="_blank" href="https://sites.google.com/site/cudatraining/">CUDA workshop</a> presented (or should I say <a target="_blank" href="https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=workshop+presented%2Cworkshop+conducted&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t1%3B%2Cworkshop%20presented%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cworkshop%20conducted%3B%2Cc0">conducted</a>?) by my friend <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/AmityFarm/">Anthony Morse</a> and I’m still astounded by <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.nvidia.com/digits">DIGITS</a>. So, during the workshop, I had some interesting ideas to use on this post!</p>

<p>The first thing I thought when I read (or heard?) for the first time the name <strong>Convolutional Neural Network</strong> was <em>a bunch of <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(image_processing)">filters</a></em> (<a target="_blank" href="https://docs.gimp.org/en/plug-in-convmatrix.html">Gimp would agree with me</a>). I’m an Electrical Engineer and, for most of us (Electrical Engineers), convolutions start as nightmares and, gradually, become our almighty super weapon after a module like <a target="_blank" href="https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-6-007-signals-and-systems-spring-2011/">Signal and Systems</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s start with something easy… a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puxHUGpuOVw">video</a>! Below, you can observe, step-by-step, what happens when a 2D convolution (think about a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_detection">filter</a> that detects, or enhances, edges) is applied to an image:</p>

        How to keep things running after you close your terminal (Linux/Unix)
      </a>
    </h1>
    <span class="post-date">28 Feb 2017</span>
    <p>When you start playing with cloud computing like <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a>, you will, sometimes, decide to launch a program that will take a while to run. If you simply close the connection before all processes are finished, the system will terminate <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/">bash</a> (or whatever <a target="_blank" href="http://www.freeos.com/guides/lsst/ch01sec07.html">shell</a> you were using) and, therefore, your program will be also terminated. Normally, when we are working on a terminal, we make use of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">&amp;</code> (or <code class="highlighter-rouge">ctrl+z</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">bg</code>) to send things to the background freeing the terminal. If you sent your process to background, you will be able to use <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/unix-linux-jobs-command-examples-usage-syntax/"><code class="highlighter-rouge">jobs</code></a> to display information about processes that are sleeping (the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ctrl+z</code> thing) or running on the background.</p>

        My Old Projects or Why You Should Document and Share Your Stuff Online
      </a>
    </h1>
    <span class="post-date">19 Dec 2016</span>
    <p>Today, I’ve decided to write something to make sure I’m not going to forget, again, about my old projects. Another reason for this post is to be an incentive for sharing / publishing your work online. If I had published everything online, as I was developing, I would not need to write a post about things from the past like I’m doing right now ;)  </p>

<p>When I was still an undergrad student (2000-2005), mobile phones with good quality cameras were not available and only in 2004 (or 2005?) I got one with a really noisy, probably VGA, camera.  I was only able to have such a phone because I found an unsolvable bug on my old one, while still on guarantee, and they had no choice but give me a better one (Brazil has some really nice consumer protection laws). Also, Dropbox, GoogleDrive, etc were not available and it was quite common to lose data from time to time after a problem with a hard drive.</p>

<p>During my years as an undergrad Electrical Engineering student, I’ve developed some interesting projects, but most of them I’ve not saved any picture, schematic, etc. For one of my analog electronics modules, my group designed a circuit to multiply two input signals using only transistors. I still remember that Analog Devices had one IC that could do exactly what we struggled to build for that module. The control systems module demanded us to develop an analog PID controller and I implemented a controller for CPU fans. Later on, I’ve worked on a Neural Network implementation using FPGA that should be able to recognise simple numbers. All those projects are lost, since I don’t have backup of anything or photos. My first project to have a digital picture saved was during the microcontrollers module. My group designed a home automation system, based on 8051, where you could activate relays through DTMF. Here is the picture (we recycled my old 56K USRobotics faxmodem plastic enclosure):</p>

    <p>This is my first attempt using <a target="_blank" href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>. It all started because my colleague, Massimiliano, showed me his brand new Jekyll based <a target="_blank" href="http://mpatacchiola.github.io/">website</a>. Actually, I’d tried Jekyll before, but when I read the <a target="_blank" href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/">first lines</a> asking me to install <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://rubygems.org">RubyGems</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://nodejs.org/en/">NodeJS</a> and then install <a target="_blank" href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, I instantaneously gave up. I was way too used to deploy and admin WordPress websites, so I could not accept the idea of not being able to have a web-only system. Luckily, Github does everything and it’s NOT necessary to install anything on you computer to use Jekyll with Github!</p>

<p>My plan, for the future, is to keep this website updated with what I’m currently doing (and, maybe, try to document some old projects too).</p>

<p>And, finally, here it is:</p>
